                    Auditing online privacy has become critical to ensure compliance with the upcoming data privacy laws. However, this work 
                    highlights the variability in the forms of disclosures. We propose a <strong> uniform machine readable disclosure form </strong> 
                    that can be used to automate the auditing process. This would allow authorities to match the disclosures with the actual 
                    data practices of the company on a scale without the need for manual intervention.

                    A users' data is often propagated to multiple third-party services through ad-networks. This work uses the ad 
                    content served to a user, to identify the ad-networks that are responsible for the data propagation. Unlike 
                    previous works in this space, it does not depend on any artifact that is ephemeral in nature. Our results 
                    indicate the feasibility of this approach and its potential to be used as a tool for privacy audits.

                    Community-level moderation for Reddit and similar platforms is a complex task. Our analysis show that 
                    <strong> subreddits are constantly changing and therefore timely interventions are prohibitively expesnsive </strong> 
                    because of the scale. To address this issue, we propose a flagging tool which aids administrators by 
                    <strong> flagging subreddits that exhibit similarly problematic behavior as seen in previously banned communities </strong>.

                    The driving force behind all activity on the Internet is user data. This work proposes a novel matrix approach to
                    set up traps using email addresses, to detect the misuse of user data once it has been shared with third-party apps. 
                    We find several apps share data with malicious entities which consequently use it for phishing or ransomware attacks.
